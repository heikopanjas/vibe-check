Analyze the workspace and read the following instruction files in order:

1. AGENTS.md (primary instructions file)

**Confirm you've read and understood these instructions before we begin. Also remember to update the instructions as we go.**

When making updates, in AGENTS.md maintain the "Last updated" timestamp at the top and add entries to the "Recent Updates & Decisions" log at the bottom with the date, brief description, and reasoning for each change. Ensure the file maintains this structure: title header, timestamp line, main instructions content, then the "Recent Updates & Decisions" section at the end.

**NEVER** commit automatically. Whenever I ask you to commit the changes, stage the changes, write a detailed but still concise commit message using conventional commits format and commit the changes. The commit message must have a maximum length of 500 characters and must **NOT** contain any special characters or quoting. This is **CRITICAL**!
