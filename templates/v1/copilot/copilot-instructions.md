# ⚠️ SESSION NOT INITIALIZED PROPERLY

If you're reading this, the user probably forgot to run `/init-session`.

**STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask:**
"Should I run /init-session first to properly initialize this session?"

If the user confirms, run the slash command. If they say no, then:
- READ AGENTS.md
- Proceed with their request

DO NOT proceed with commits or code changes without either:
  1. Running /init-session, OR
  2. Reading AGENTS.md
