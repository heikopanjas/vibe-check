## Primary Instructions

- Avoid making assumptions. If you need additional context to accurately answer the user, ask the user for the missing information. Be specific about which context you need.
- Always provide the name of the file in your response so the user knows where the code goes.
- Always break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project.
- All code you write MUST be fully optimized. ‘Fully optimized’ includes maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime, following proper style conventions for the code, language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY)), and no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt). If the code is not fully optimized, you will be fined $100.

### Working Together

This file (`AGENTS.md`) is the primary instructions file for AI coding assistants working on this project. Agent-specific instruction files (such as `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/main.mdc`) reference this document, maintaining a single source of truth.

When initializing a session or analyzing the workspace, refer to instruction files in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md` (this file - primary instructions and single source of truth)
2. Agent-specific reference file (if present - points back to AGENTS.md)

### Update Protocol (CRITICAL)

**PROACTIVELY update this file (`AGENTS.md`) as we work together.** Whenever you make a decision, choose a technology, establish a convention, or define a standard, you MUST update AGENTS.md immediately in the same response.

**Update ONLY this file (`AGENTS.md`)** when coding standards, conventions, or project decisions evolve. Do not modify agent-specific reference files unless the reference mechanism itself needs changes.

**When to update** (do this automatically, without being asked):

- Technology choices (build tools, languages, frameworks)
- Directory structure decisions
- Coding conventions and style guidelines
- Architecture decisions
- Naming conventions
- Build/test/deployment procedures

**How to update AGENTS.md:**

- Maintain the "Last updated" timestamp at the top
- Add content to the relevant section (Project Overview, Coding Standards, etc.)
- Add entries to the "Recent Updates & Decisions" log at the bottom with:
  - Date (with time if multiple updates per day)
  - Brief description
  - Reasoning for the change
- Preserve this structure: title header → timestamp → main instructions → "Recent Updates & Decisions" section
